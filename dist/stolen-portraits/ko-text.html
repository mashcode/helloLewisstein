In other societies, certain kinds of stealing are condoned but actually encouraged, even eulogized. Lewis Stein’s offense clearly belongs to the second category. The ancient Chinese have a name for him: "The elegant thief." In snatching something away he imparts new meanings and possibilities onto them, making them richer, more intriguing and more poetic.</p> <p>"Stolen portraits" are born at the intersection of deliberate posing and happenstance. Impressed by the frequency and fanfare with which tourists in China propped themselves in front of a famous or not-so- famous site, Lewis Stein would sneak up to the photographer as closely as possible with his own point-and-shoot camera. He has thus captured the famously theatrical Chinese in formal, exaggerated poses but slightly off- guard. Against the backdrop of a misty lake, the left index finger of a young woman in a pink raincoat still rests poetically on the carved stone post on a bridge, but her eyes have already drifted away.</p> <p>Mostly taken (stolen) in 1993, followed by a handful in the late 1990s and early 2000s, these portraits document the first wave of domestic tourism in post-Mao China, as the nascent middle class started to take their leisure onto the road. As such "Stolen Portraits" are portraits of an entire nation caught in an instant of in-betweenness. The old kingdom, waking up, still coiled stubbornly around the pillar in the forbidden palace like a tired dragon, but many people have begun to look away, dreaming other dreams.</p> <p>Tribal peoples cursed and ducked upon their first encounters with the camera, afraid that the mysterious box would steal their souls. May we all see the world as these visionaries. Unlike us jaded, hyper-rational westerners, they saw cameras as they really are machines pregnant with potent magic and fantasy; vehicles of alchemic transformation from solid matter to image and spirit.</p> <p>No, Lewis Stein did not steal the Chinese’s souls, but in stealing a snapshot or two (O.K., one hundred) he has left behind a bit of himself in the faraway land. In seeing the Chinese as they saw themselves, albeit a bit off-kilter and off-centered, he has given his eyesight and insights to them as an eternal gift. In this playful economy, when an elegant thief steals everybody benefits. This is a world in which all of us—takers and givers, Westerners and Easterners--can live happily together.</p> <p>Dorothy Ko<br> Barnard College, Columbia University</p> </div> <div id="wrapper-foot"></div> </div>  </div>  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>  <script src="../scripts/bootstrap.js"></script> <script src="../scripts/main.js"></script> </body> </html>
